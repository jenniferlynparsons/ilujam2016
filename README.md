My game project for #ilujam 2016

## a romantic/action rpg

you are a mage/rogue/warrior out on a date with your mage/rogue/warrior lover. you’re a little bit famous, having defeated a dragon and saved a city. friend of the monarch, and your lover is one of your adventuring party. you haven’t been together that long as a couple, though you know each other well.

you’ve been traveling for weeks and come to a small city where you are due to meet the monarch. the city is a bit notorious for having a criminal element. 

your relationship has been strained because of the hardships of the road, so your partner proposes a night on the town. just some good food, a stroll through the bazaar, a visit to the town’s lucky kissing bridge.

while you are trying to enjoy your dinner, you are attacked by bandits. dispatch them and continue with the evening.

attacks keep coming and it seems you’ve caught the local crime boss’s attention. your partner is not pleased with this turn of events and has been strained emotionally to the breaking point.

status of your relationship can effect how powerful spells are during joint combat, normalize if things are good or after breakup.

two main goals:
- uncover the plot to kill the monarch and kill the conspirators
- either keep your relationship alive and well or break up

lots of randomness:
- partner can be picked from boy, girl, neutral or randomly chosen
- weather for the date can be nice, gloomy, cold (displayed as background color changes)
- monarch can be picked from boy, girl, neutral or randomly chosen
- partner’s personality can be chosen or random between diplomatic/funny/aggressive (requires a LOT of extra writing)
- available spells/powers randomly chosen from larger set

i don't think i'll be able to get all the randomness in, especially the partner's personality, before the end of the jam, but i'll do as much as i can!
